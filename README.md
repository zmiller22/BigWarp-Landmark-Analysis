# BigWarp-Landmark-Analysis
Provides tools for visualizing and quantifying transformations generated in FIJI BigWarp. Also allows for removal of landmark points that are unlikely to be correct based on the transformation generated by a small set of high quality landmarks.

# Usage
This code was developed with the intention of use by the Engert lab only. While others are welcome to use it, the code and its accompanying documentation is specifically written for members of the Engert lab, and therefore may not contain adequate functionality/documentation for other users.

TODO write up complete documentation for the version 1.0 release
